        <h2>Master Top Riven Main</h2>
        <p>My Story with Riven: On 2017 Summer Vacation, I started my riven journey with my old Macbook Pro. But way before that, I was a silver IV player on the chinese server and playing Jax,Lux and Teemo. One years later, I reached platinum II
          with Brand support. One day I was watching random videos on Youtube. I found a video called Theshy Riven montage and clicked on it. I was shocked by Theshy's riven mechanics and what he can do with riven. I decided to practice and become a
          riven main. Since 2017 summerÔºå I have played riven for almost 4 years now and never got tired of playing her. She is the reason why I am keep playing league of legends and will kepp on playing. The reason why I like to play riven is
          beacuase riven is a champion that requires combo mastery and matchup knowledge. I enjoy the grind and practice as riven in which I would wake up in the morning and practice combos and watching tutorials for hours without getting bored. And
          I would say riven is a champion that can do things that other champions cannot such as solo carry and outplay enemy extremely hard once mastered. My intention of building this website is sharing my experience and recording my riven journey
          and wishing other riven lovers can benefit from visiting my website!
